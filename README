netstat-monitor is a command line tool for monitoring network connections. It
displays current connections when run, similar to netstat, and then continues
to watch for and report new connections as they are made.

Filters can be created to filter out connections that should not be reported. This
helps limit the output, to see only interesting or unexpected connections. To
do this, edit the netstat-monitor file and add filters to the filters list. Here 
are some examples:

    # Filter out expected firefox connections for user alice.
    GenericFilter(exe='/usr/lib/firefox/firefox', user='alice', remote_ports = ['53', '80', '443']),

    # Filter out expected connections from ntpupdate.
    GenericFilter(exe='/usr/sbin/ntpdate', user='root'),

    # Filter out expected ssh connections.
    GenericFilter(cmdline='ssh alice@login.trilug.org', user='alice'),

By default netstat-monitor checks for new connections every second. This can be changed
with the interval argument passed to the Monitor() constructor, in netstat-monitor. Lower
values will make it less likely netstat-monitor will miss a connection, but will increase
CPU load.
